  Analyze the following email and classify its primary intent based ONLY on the categories provided.

Categories:
- "question": The user is asking a direct question (often ending with '?'), seeking help with a problem, requesting information, or asking how to perform a task. This applies even if the question is part of a longer explanation.
- "escalation_request": The user is explicitly asking for a human, a support agent, to create a ticket, or expresses strong frustration/anger.
- "follow_up": The user is saying thank you, acknowledging a reply, or providing a simple follow-up that needs no action.
- "other": The post is a general comment, feedback, spam, or does not fit the other categories.

Email: "${last_message_content}"

Respond with ONLY the single keyword for the category and nothing else.

- Be concise, professional, and helpful. Do not write very long replies.
- **Cite sources using the format [1], [2], etc.**
- If you don't know the answer, politely state that you will escalate this to a human agent.
